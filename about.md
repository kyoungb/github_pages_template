## Background

I’m a senior at Brigham Young University studying Statistics, with a focus on biostatistics and applications of data in real-world problem solving. As the student representative for BYU Biostatistics, I enjoy connecting peers with opportunities to grow in this field and exploring how statistical methods can drive meaningful insights.

I’m especially excited about the intersection of statistics and artificial intelligence. Through my work with Pixydocs, a machine learning company, I’m gaining hands-on experience with the implementation of automation in the workplace. My current projects center on finding efficient, practical solutions to tedious tasks—like streamlining bookkeeping—so people can focus more on what matters most in their work.

Beyond academics and work, I’m passionate about living life with curiosity and adventure. You’ll often find me rock climbing, running, zip-lining, or hiking with my husband, Zach.

I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and help build data-driven solutions that make life easier and better.
