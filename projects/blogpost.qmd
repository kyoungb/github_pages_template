# Measuring the Mental Cost of Social Media

## Introduction

Mental health is a growing public health concern. In this tutorial, I will show you how to compare **levels of social media use** with **self-reported mental well-being**.\

I will demonstrate how simple survey data analysis can reveal correlations between screen use and depression.\
Disclaimer: This project will show correlation, **not causation**.

## Data & Methods

### Data Import 

-   Source: CDC YRBSS (most recent release; SAS format converted to CSV).\
-   Variables of interest:
    -   `Social Media Use` (hours per day)\
    -   `Depression` (increased feelings of depression)

### Steps

1.  **Load and clean data**

    ``` python
   import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv('smmh.csv')

    df.head()

    ```

2.  **Categorize social media use**

    -   0 (Less than an hour)\
    -   1 (1-2 hrs/day)\
    -   2 (2-3 hrs/day)\
    -   3 (3-4 hrs/day)\
    -   4 (4-5 hrs/day)\
    -   5 (5+ hrs/day)\

3.  **Compute average depression score** by group.\

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
from scipy.stats import chi2
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

crosstabDT = pd.crosstab(index = df.AvgTime , columns = df.Depressed)
sns.heatmap(crosstabDT, annot = True, fmt='d')

plt.title('Mental hlth lol')

plt.show()
```

## Results

### Average Depression Scores by Social Media Use



```python
data = {
    "Depressed": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Less than an Hour": [14, 12, 4, 2, 2],
    "Between 1 and 2 hours": [13, 18, 20, 8, 11],
    "Between 2 and 3 hours": [13, 21, 21, 27, 19],
    "Between 3 and 4 hours": [10, 10, 30, 22, 21],
    "Between 4 and 5 hours": [5, 10, 15, 24, 13],
    "More than 5 hours": [5, 12, 27, 33, 39]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index("Depressed")


averages = {}
for col in df.columns:
    total_counts = df[col].sum()
    weighted_sum = (df.index * df[col]).sum()  
    averages[col] = weighted_sum / total_counts


avg_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(averages, orient="index", columns=["Average Depression Score"])
print(avg_scores)
```

| Social Media Use | Avg. Depression Score |
|:-----------------|-------------------:|
| 0 (<1 hr/day)        |               2.00 |
| 1 (1-2 hrs/day)      |               2.80 |
| 2 (2-3 hrs/day)      |               3.18 |
| 3 (3-4 hrs/day)      |               3.37 |
| 4 (4-5 hrs/day)      |               3.45 |
| 5 (5+ hrs/day)       |               3.77 |

### Visualization

```python 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data (from previous calculation)
averages = {
    "Less than an Hour": 1.74,
    "Between 1 and 2 hours": 2.54,
    "Between 2 and 3 hours": 3.02,
    "Between 3 and 4 hours": 3.23,
    "Between 4 and 5 hours": 3.42,
    "More than 5 hours": 4.02
}

# Convert to DataFrame
avg_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(averages, orient="index", columns=["Average Depression Score"])

# Plot as bar chart
ax = avg_scores.plot(kind="bar", legend=False, figsize=(8,5), color="skyblue")

# Titles and labels
plt.title("Average Depression Score by Time Spent", fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel("Average Time Category")
plt.ylabel("Average Depression Score")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")  # tilt labels for readability
plt.ylim(0,5)  # since scores are on a 1–5 scale

# Show chart
plt.show()
```

## Discussion

-   **Pattern observed (demo data):** Higher reported anxiety is associated with heavier social media use.\
-   **Strengths:** Large, nationally representative dataset (when using actual YRBSS).\
-   **Limitations:**
    -   Correlation ≠ causation.\
    -   Self-reported data may introduce bias.\
    -   Potential confounders (family, academics, socioeconomic status) not modeled here.

## Call to Action

-   **For peers:** Apply these steps to other **health-related datasets** and share reproducible analyses on GitHub Pages.\
-   **Practical skill:** Data wrangling + Markdown summaries make public health data **accessible** and **persuasive**.
