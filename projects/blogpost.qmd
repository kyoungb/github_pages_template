## Introduction

Mental health has become one of the most pressing public health challenges of our time. In this brief data and coding tutorial, we will walk through a simple data analysis project that explores the relationship between **social media use** and **self-reported mental well-being**.\

Using data and Pandas functions found in Python packages, we will demonstrate how to clean, categorize, and visualize survey responses to see potential correlations between screen time and depression.\
Disclaimer: This analysis will  only show correlation, **not causation**.

## Data & Methods

### Data Import 

For this project, we will use a publicly available dataset from Kaggle's Public Health domain. The two key variables we'll focus on within our dataset are:
    - `Social Media Use` (hours per day)\
    - `Depression` (self-reported increase in depressive feelings)

We'll start by importing the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame so we can begin cleaning and analyzing it. 

    ``` python
   import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv('smmh.csv')

    ```

### Step 1: Categorize Social Media Use

To make comparisons clearer, we’ll categorize respondents into time-use categories based on their daily social media usage.

    -   0 -> Less than an hour\
    -   1 -> 1-2 hrs/day\
    -   2 -> 2-3 hrs/day\
    -   3 -> 3-4 hrs/day\
    -   4 -> 4-5 hrs/day\
    -   5 -> 5+ hrs/day\

### Step 2: Compute Average Depression by Group.**\

Next, we’ll calculate how depression scores differ across these categories. A heatmap provides a quick way to visualize the relationship between **time spent on social media** and **self-reported depression**.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
from scipy.stats import chi2
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

crosstabDT = pd.crosstab(index = df.AvgTime , columns = df.Depressed)
sns.heatmap(crosstabDT, annot = True, fmt='d')

plt.title('Mental Health and Media Use')

plt.show()
```

## Results

Looking at the heatmap, you may notice a trend: the groups reporting the most daily social media use also tend to show higher depression scores. To better quantify this relationship, let’s calculate the **average depression score** for each category using python's averages functions. 


```python
data = {
    "Depressed": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Less than an Hour": [14, 12, 4, 2, 2],
    "Between 1 and 2 hours": [13, 18, 20, 8, 11],
    "Between 2 and 3 hours": [13, 21, 21, 27, 19],
    "Between 3 and 4 hours": [10, 10, 30, 22, 21],
    "Between 4 and 5 hours": [5, 10, 15, 24, 13],
    "More than 5 hours": [5, 12, 27, 33, 39]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index("Depressed")


averages = {}
for col in df.columns:
    total_counts = df[col].sum()
    weighted_sum = (df.index * df[col]).sum()  
    averages[col] = weighted_sum / total_counts


avg_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(averages, orient="index", columns=["Average Depression Score"])

```

Here’s a summary table of the results:

| Social Media Use | Avg. Depression Score |
|:-----------------|-------------------:|
| 0 (<1 hr/day)        |               2.00 |
| 1 (1-2 hrs/day)      |               2.80 |
| 2 (2-3 hrs/day)      |               3.18 |
| 3 (3-4 hrs/day)      |               3.37 |
| 4 (4-5 hrs/day)      |               3.45 |
| 5 (5+ hrs/day)       |               3.77 |

### Visualization

To make this trend easy to see, let's plot these averages as a bar chart with matplotlib.pyplot and pandas packages!

```python 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data (from previous calculation)
averages = {
    "Less than an Hour": 2,
    "Between 1 and 2 hours": 2.8,
    "Between 2 and 3 hours": 3.18,
    "Between 3 and 4 hours": 3.37,
    "Between 4 and 5 hours": 3.45,
    "More than 5 hours": 3.77
}

# Convert to DataFrame
avg_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(averages, orient="index", columns=["Average Depression Score"])

# Plot as bar chart
ax = avg_scores.plot(kind="bar", legend=False, figsize=(8,5), color="skyblue")

# Titles and labels
plt.title("Average Depression Score by Time Spent", fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel("Average Time Category")
plt.ylabel("Average Depression Score")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")  # tilt labels for readability
plt.ylim(0,5)  # since scores are on a 1–5 scale

# Show chart
plt.show()
```

### Discussion
From this simple analysis, a clear pattern emerges: **higher reported depression is associated with heavier social media use.**/

- **Strengths:** The dataset is relatively large, making trends easier to detect./

- **Limitations:**/

    - Correlation ≠ causation./

    - Self-reported data introduces bias./

    - Important confounders (family, academics, socioeconomic status, etc.) are not included here./ 


### Call to Action

This tutorial demonstrates how a few lines of code can uncover meaningful patterns in public health data.

- **For students and peers:** Try applying these steps to other health-related datasets and share your findings.

- **Practical takeaway:** Combining Python, Markdown, and visualization tools helps make data analysis **clear, reproducible, and persuasive.**
