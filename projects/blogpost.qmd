# Measuring the Mental Cost of Social Media

## Introduction

Mental health is a growing public health concern. In this tutorial, I will show you how to compare **levels of social media use** with **self-reported mental well-being**.\

I will demonstrate how simple survey data analysis can reveal correlations between screen use and depression.\
Disclaimer: This project will show correlation, **not causation**.

## Data & Methods

### Data Import 

-   Source: Kaggle Public Health Domain Dataset.\
-   Variables of interest:
    -   `Social Media Use` (hours per day)\
    -   `Depression` (increased feelings of depression)

### Steps

1.  **Upload and format data**

I will use a code block, as seen here, to load and format my data correctly. If you would like, you can use the function df.head() to properly visualize your data. 


    ``` python
   import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv('smmh.csv')

    ```

2.  **Categorize social media use**

I will take responses from "AvgTime" (average time spent on social media daily) to organize my survey response data. 

    -   0 (Less than an hour)\
    -   1 (1-2 hrs/day)\
    -   2 (2-3 hrs/day)\
    -   3 (3-4 hrs/day)\
    -   4 (4-5 hrs/day)\
    -   5 (5+ hrs/day)\

3.  **Compute average depression score** by group.\

I will then utilize a heat density plot to display the number of respondents in each category, showing the average time spent on social media cross-tabulated with the self-reported levels of depression. 

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
from scipy.stats import chi2
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

crosstabDT = pd.crosstab(index = df.AvgTime , columns = df.Depressed)
sns.heatmap(crosstabDT, annot = True, fmt='d')

plt.title('Mental Health and Media Use')

plt.show()
```

## Results

Notice how the highest rates of depression were also reported by the group that spent the most time on social media daily? Let's take a look at average depression scores by using python to do some math. 

### Average Depression Scores by Social Media Use



```python
data = {
    "Depressed": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Less than an Hour": [14, 12, 4, 2, 2],
    "Between 1 and 2 hours": [13, 18, 20, 8, 11],
    "Between 2 and 3 hours": [13, 21, 21, 27, 19],
    "Between 3 and 4 hours": [10, 10, 30, 22, 21],
    "Between 4 and 5 hours": [5, 10, 15, 24, 13],
    "More than 5 hours": [5, 12, 27, 33, 39]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index("Depressed")


averages = {}
for col in df.columns:
    total_counts = df[col].sum()
    weighted_sum = (df.index * df[col]).sum()  
    averages[col] = weighted_sum / total_counts


avg_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(averages, orient="index", columns=["Average Depression Score"])

```

After finding the results, let's plug them into a table using Markdown table techniques to show the numbers side by side! 

| Social Media Use | Avg. Depression Score |
|:-----------------|-------------------:|
| 0 (<1 hr/day)        |               2.00 |
| 1 (1-2 hrs/day)      |               2.80 |
| 2 (2-3 hrs/day)      |               3.18 |
| 3 (3-4 hrs/day)      |               3.37 |
| 4 (4-5 hrs/day)      |               3.45 |
| 5 (5+ hrs/day)       |               3.77 |

### Visualization

Now, we will take the numbers found in our table and plug them in to a bar chart created with matplotlib.pyplot and pandas packages!

```python 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data (from previous calculation)
averages = {
    "Less than an Hour": 2,
    "Between 1 and 2 hours": 2.8,
    "Between 2 and 3 hours": 3.18,
    "Between 3 and 4 hours": 3.37,
    "Between 4 and 5 hours": 3.45,
    "More than 5 hours": 3.77
}

# Convert to DataFrame
avg_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(averages, orient="index", columns=["Average Depression Score"])

# Plot as bar chart
ax = avg_scores.plot(kind="bar", legend=False, figsize=(8,5), color="skyblue")

# Titles and labels
plt.title("Average Depression Score by Time Spent", fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel("Average Time Category")
plt.ylabel("Average Depression Score")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")  # tilt labels for readability
plt.ylim(0,5)  # since scores are on a 1–5 scale

# Show chart
plt.show()
```

## Discussion
We will now take a look at the patterns and record our observations about the data. 

-   **Pattern observed:** Higher reported depression is associated with heavier social media use.\
-   **Strengths:** Large dataset.\
-   **Limitations:**
    -   Correlation ≠ causation.\
    -   Self-reported data may introduce bias.\
    -   Potential confounders (family, academics, socioeconomic status) not modeled here.

## Call to Action

-   **For peers:** Apply these steps to other **health-related datasets** and share reproducible analyses on GitHub Pages.\
-   **Practical skill:** Data wrangling + Markdown summaries make public health data **accessible** and **persuasive**.
