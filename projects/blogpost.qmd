# Measuring the Mental Cost of Social Media

## Introduction

Teenagers’ mental health is a growing public health concern. In this tutorial, I will show you how to compare **levels of social media use** with **self-reported mental well-being** from the latest CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS).\

I will demonstrate how simple survey data analysis can reveal correlations between screen use and anxiety.\
Disclaimer: This project will show correlation, **not causation**.

## Data & Methods

### Data Import 

-   Source: CDC YRBSS (most recent release; SAS format converted to CSV).\
-   Variables of interest:
    -   `Social Media Use` (hours per day)\
    -   `Current Mental Health` (anxiety/well-being rating)

### Steps

1.  **Load and clean data**

    ``` python
    import pandas as pd

    # read SAS file
    df = pd.read_sas("2023XXH-Formats-Program.sas")

    # save to CSV
    df.to_csv("2023XXH-Formats-Program.csv", index=False)
    df(head)
    ```

2.  **Categorize social media use**

    -   Low (0–2 hrs/day)\
    -   Medium (3–5 hrs/day)\
    -   High (6+ hrs/day)\

3.  **Compute average anxiety score** by group.\

4.  **Summarize findings** with a Markdown table and a bar chart.

## Results

### Average Anxiety Scores by Social Media Use

| Social Media Use | Avg. Anxiety Score |
|:-----------------|-------------------:|
| Low (0–2h)       |               2.75 |
| Medium (3–5h)    |               3.23 |
| High (6h+)       |               4.02 |

## Discussion

-   **Pattern observed (demo data):** Higher reported anxiety is associated with heavier social media use.\
-   **Strengths:** Large, nationally representative dataset (when using actual YRBSS).\
-   **Limitations:**
    -   Correlation ≠ causation.\
    -   Self-reported data may introduce bias.\
    -   Potential confounders (family, academics, socioeconomic status) not modeled here.

## Call to Action

-   **For peers:** Apply these steps to other **health-related datasets** and share reproducible analyses on GitHub Pages.\
-   **Practical skill:** Data wrangling + Markdown summaries make public health data **accessible** and **persuasive**.
